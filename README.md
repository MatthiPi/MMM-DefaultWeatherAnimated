# MMM-DefaultWeatherAnimated

Adds animated icons and changes layout of default weather plugin

I did not find any weather plugin with nice animated icons that fitted my needs.
So I took the default one and changed it a little ;)



## Preview

## Installation
Setup Default Weather Module (https://docs.magicmirror.builders/modules/weather.html)

Copy and override files
* icons.css -> MagicMirror/modules/default/weather/   (copy)
* forecast.njk -> MagicMirror/modules/default/weather/    (override)
* current.njk -> MagicMirror/modules/default/weather/   (override)
* weather.js -> MagicMirror/modules/default/weather/    (override)



created with icons from:

I know changing files of another module is not the best solution but it was the easiest for me.
